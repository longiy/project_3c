# 3C Framework for Game Development

## Introduction: Why 3C Matters in Game Design

The **3C Framework** provides game developers with a systematic approach to designing player experience by configuring three fundamental axes: **Character**, **Camera**, and **Control**. Every game can be understood as a specific configuration of these elements, and intentional 3C design is what separates memorable experiences from generic ones.

### The Game Developer's 3C Questions
1. **Character:** "Who is the player in this game world?"
2. **Camera:** "How does the player perceive and understand the game space?"
3. **Control:** "What can the player do, and how do they do it?"

## Character Axis: Player Identity & Agency

### **Character Types in Games**

#### **Observer**
*Player watches but doesn't directly control*
- **Examples:** Cutscenes, some puzzle games, visual novels
- **Design considerations:** Focus on cinematography, pacing, information revelation
- **Implementation:** Fixed camera positions, automatic progression, minimal input requirements

#### **Avatar**
*Player directly controls a character representation*
- **Examples:** Link in Zelda, Master Chief in Halo, most action games
- **Design considerations:** Character responsiveness, visual feedback, embodiment quality
- **Implementation:** Direct input-to-movement mapping, character animation systems, collision detection

#### **Commander**
*Player controls multiple units or systems*
- **Examples:** RTS games, squad-based tactics, management sims
- **Design considerations:** Clear unit feedback, selection systems, command clarity
- **Implementation:** Multi-selection interfaces, unit AI, formation systems

#### **Architect**
*Player shapes or creates the game world*
- **Examples:** Minecraft, SimCity, level editors
- **Design considerations:** Creative tools, building constraints, sharing systems
- **Implementation:** Modular building systems, save/load functionality, asset libraries

### **Character Design Principles**

**Consistency:** Character behavior should match player expectations
**Responsiveness:** Input should translate to immediate, clear feedback
**Progression:** Character capabilities should evolve meaningfully
**Embodiment:** Player should feel "present" in the character

## Camera Axis: Information Architecture & Perspective

### **Camera Systems in Games**

#### **Fixed Camera**
*Static viewpoint, player moves within frame*
- **Best for:** Puzzle games, classic horror, artistic framing
- **Examples:** Early Resident Evil, Monument Valley, many indie games
- **Implementation:** Pre-positioned camera nodes, trigger-based transitions
- **Design considerations:** Ensure all important areas are visible, avoid player confusion during transitions

#### **Following Camera**
*Camera tracks player with some lag or smoothing*
- **Best for:** 2D platformers, top-down action games
- **Examples:** Super Mario Bros, Hotline Miami
- **Implementation:** Lerp-based position tracking, boundary constraints
- **Design considerations:** Smooth movement, appropriate follow distance, boundary handling

#### **Orbital Camera**
*Player controls camera rotation around character*
- **Best for:** 3D action games, exploration games
- **Examples:** Dark Souls, Zelda BOTW, most modern 3D games
- **Implementation:** SpringArm3D in Godot, camera rotation around pivot point
- **Design considerations:** Collision handling, rotation speed, angle constraints

#### **First-Person Camera**
*Camera positioned at character's eye level*
- **Best for:** Immersive experiences, shooters, exploration
- **Examples:** Portal, Minecraft, FPS games
- **Implementation:** Camera as child of character controller, head bobbing, mouse look
- **Design considerations:** FOV settings, motion sickness prevention, weapon positioning

#### **Hybrid/Contextual Camera**
*Camera system changes based on game context*
- **Best for:** Games with varied gameplay types
- **Examples:** Grand Theft Auto (driving vs walking), Bayonetta (combat vs exploration)
- **Implementation:** State-based camera systems, smooth transitions between modes
- **Design considerations:** Clear transition triggers, consistent player expectations

### **Camera Design Principles**

**Clarity:** Player should always understand spatial relationships
**Comfort:** Avoid motion sickness and disorientation
**Control:** Give players appropriate camera agency for the game type
**Context:** Camera should serve the current gameplay need

## Control Axis: Player Actions & Input Systems

### **Control Schemes by Game Type**

#### **Direct Control**
*Immediate input-to-action mapping*
- **Best for:** Action games, platformers, real-time experiences
- **Examples:** Fighting games, shooters, racing games
- **Implementation:** Direct velocity control, immediate response systems
- **Design considerations:** Input buffering, frame-perfect timing, accessibility options

#### **Target-Based Control**
*Player selects destinations or targets*
- **Best for:** Strategy games, tactical RPGs, point-and-click adventures
- **Examples:** Diablo, RTS games, classic adventure games
- **Implementation:** Pathfinding systems, interaction highlighting, queue management
- **Design considerations:** Clear target feedback, pathfinding visualization, error handling

#### **Mode-Based Control**
*Different input meanings in different contexts*
- **Best for:** Complex simulations, RPGs with multiple systems
- **Examples:** Flight simulators, complex RPGs, creative tools
- **Implementation:** Input context stacks, mode indicators, help systems
- **Design considerations:** Clear mode communication, consistent mode switching, tutorial systems

#### **Gesture/Pattern Control**
*Complex inputs create specific actions*
- **Best for:** Fighting games, rhythm games, spell-casting systems
- **Examples:** Street Fighter, Guitar Hero, Ni No Kuni
- **Implementation:** Input sequence detection, timing windows, pattern matching
- **Design considerations:** Learning curves, accessibility, feedback systems

### **Control Design Principles**

**Learnability:** Controls should be discoverable and memorable
**Precision:** Input accuracy should match game requirements
**Feedback:** Every input should have clear, immediate response
**Accessibility:** Consider different player abilities and preferences

## 3C Configuration Patterns by Genre

### **Action/Adventure (e.g., Zelda BOTW)**
- **Character:** Avatar (direct character control)
- **Camera:** Orbital (player-controlled 3D camera)
- **Control:** Direct (immediate movement) + Target-based (interaction)
- **Why it works:** Perfect balance of agency, spatial awareness, and responsive action

### **First-Person Shooter (e.g., DOOM)**
- **Character:** Avatar (embodied shooter)
- **Camera:** First-person (immersive perspective)
- **Control:** Direct (immediate aim/movement)
