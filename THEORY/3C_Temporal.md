Refined 3C Framework: Visual Experience in Discrete Temporal Windows
Framework Scope & Disclaimers
Temporal Boundary Definition
This framework analyzes visual experience within specific time windows:

Games: Minute-to-minute gameplay moments
Films: Scene-by-scene or sequence-by-sequence
Art: Single viewing session (gallery visit, painting observation)
Interface: Task-completion episodes (login flow, navigation sequence)

Important: The framework does not address:

Long-term narrative arcs
Cultural/historical context
Cross-session memory effects
Non-visual sensory modalities

Sensory Scope Limitation
Visual-centric for visually-abled users:

Acknowledges this is not universal accessibility
Framework would need parallel development for other sensory modalities
Visual bias is explicit limitation, not claimed universality

Refined Visual 3C Framework
Character = Visual Subject Position
"What is my visual relationship to the depicted space/action within this time window?"
Visual Agency Levels:

Observer: External to the visual scene (watching film, viewing painting)
Inhabitant: Visually positioned within the space (first-person games, VR)
Controller: Visual representation I direct (third-person avatar, cursor)
Collaborator: My visual input affects what appears (drawing, interactive installation)

Camera = Visual Framing & Information Architecture
"How is visual information structured and revealed to me in this moment?"
Information Presentation:

Fixed Frame: Static visual boundary (painting, traditional film shot)
Dynamic Frame: Moving/changing visual boundary (camera movement, scrolling)
Interactive Frame: I can alter what's visible (zoom, pan, rotate)
Responsive Frame: Frame adapts to my visual attention or actions

Visual Hierarchy:

Focused: Single clear visual priority (close-up, spotlight)
Layered: Multiple visual elements with clear hierarchy
Distributed: Multiple competing visual elements
Ambient: Environmental visual information without clear focus

Control = Visual Action Repertoire
"What visual actions can I perform within this time window?"
Visual Navigation:

Passive: Visual information flows to me (film playback, animation)
Guided: Limited visual exploration (choose from options, guided tour)
Free: Unrestricted visual exploration (open-world camera, gallery walking)
Constructive: I create/modify visual information (drawing, building)

Attention Direction:

Surrendered: Creator controls my visual focus (film editing, guided interface)
Negotiated: Shared control of visual attention (interactive media)
Independent: I control where I look (free exploration, reading)

Temporal Window Examples
Film Scene (2-3 minutes)
Dialogue Scene:

Character: Observer of conversation between actors
Camera: Fixed/Dynamic frame with shot/reverse-shot pattern
Control: Passive reception, attention follows editing cues

Action Sequence:

Character: Observer of high-stakes events
Camera: Dynamic frame with rapid cuts, varied angles
Control: Passive but heightened visual engagement

Game Combat Encounter (30 seconds - 2 minutes)
Dark Souls Boss Fight:

Character: Controller of avatar in life-or-death situation
Camera: Interactive frame I must manage while fighting
Control: Free navigation + constructive combat actions

Diablo Combat:

Character: Controller of avatar in tactical situation
Camera: Dynamic frame following action with some player control
Control: Guided navigation (click-to-move) + constructive abilities

Interface Task (10 seconds - 2 minutes)
Login Flow:

Character: Controller completing specific task
Camera: Fixed frame optimized for task completion
Control: Guided actions through predetermined sequence

Creative Software:

Character: Collaborator in creative process
Camera: Interactive frame I customize for my workflow
Control: Constructive manipulation of visual elements

Art Viewing (1-10 minutes)
Traditional Painting:

Character: Observer contemplating depicted scene/meaning
Camera: Fixed frame with embedded visual hierarchy
Control: Independent visual scanning and interpretation

Interactive Installation:

Character: Collaborator in real-time art creation
Camera: Responsive frame that changes based on my presence
Control: Constructive influence on visual output

Framework Applications
Design Analysis Tool
Compare similar experiences:

Why does Zelda BOTW exploration feel different from Assassin's Creed exploration?
BOTW: Controller + Interactive Frame + Free Navigation
AC: Controller + Dynamic Frame + Guided Navigation

Cross-Medium Design Transfer
Film techniques â†’ Game design:

Hitchcock's visual suspense techniques could inform horror game camera design
Documentary pacing could influence educational interface timing

Hybrid Experience Prediction
Unexplored combinations:

Observer + Interactive Frame + Constructive Control = ?
Collaborator + Fixed Frame + Passive Control = ?

Limitations Acknowledged
Visual Privilege

Framework explicitly excludes non-visual experiences
Would need parallel frameworks for audio, haptic, etc.
Not claiming universality - just visual utility

Temporal Atomization

Narrative flow between time windows not addressed
Memory effects from previous windows ignored
Anticipation of future windows not considered

Cultural Context Bracketing

Framework suspends cultural/historical analysis
Phenomenological reduction to immediate visual experience
Useful for micro-design decisions, not macro-cultural critique

Individual Variation

Assumes normative visual processing
Neurodivergent visual processing not addressed
Cultural visual literacy differences not considered

Conclusion: A Focused Tool
This refined framework is explicitly a microscope, not a telescope:
Good for: Moment-to-moment visual experience design, cross-medium technique transfer, systematic analysis of visual interaction patterns
Bad for: Cultural criticism, accessibility design, long-term narrative analysis, non-visual experience
Usage: Apply within clearly defined temporal and sensory boundaries, acknowledge limitations, use alongside other frameworks for complete analysis.
The framework's power comes from its focused precision, not false claims of universality.
